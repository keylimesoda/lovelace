/**
 * LoRA adapters: what is available, and what each one served.
 *
 * The two halves come from different places and are both needed. The inventory is reported by the
 * engine, so an adapter that has taken no traffic still appears. Usage is derived from completed
 * request records, so it survives replay. An adapter with no rows is discoverable and selectable
 * without ever having been used, which is exactly the case a traffic-only view would hide.
 *
 * The pool is unbounded and is not what costs VRAM; the resident slot count is. `count` adapters
 * are selectable, `slots` of them are on the device at any moment, and the engine swaps between
 * them at admission.
